Guide to using the Game Engine

Make sure you have Java 8 installed then download the skeleton project which has all the up to date dependencies.

1. Either go to https://github.com/JamesTimms/FRPSkeleton, download, fork
or pull the repository.
2. Setup the repository in your preferred development environment.
The skeleton repository has the Jar file for the game engine in it, alternatively you can download

the Game Engine and compile it into a Jar file yourself.

1. Download the game engine from https://github.com/JamesTimms/FRPGameEngine.
2. Set it up and compile it into a Jar.

To create a simple game:
3. Create a Java file that inherits from the Game interface.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class SimpleGame implements Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine.runGame(new SimpleGame());
    }

    /**
     * This is a simple game that has nothing going on.
     *
     * @return The scene graph the engine should use.
     */
    @Override
    public Scene setupScene() {
        return Scene.graph;
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example and other are in the Skeleton demo folder.
4. BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION YOU MUST SETUP LWJGL! This can be
done by setting VM options to -Djava.library.path=”native”. A complete guide can be found
here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12332381/running-lwjgl-program.

This has to be done because lwjgl needs to know where the native files are which should
be located in the skeleton. If you chose to compile the FRPGameEngine Jar yourself make
sure you download the natives for lwjgl from http://www.lwjgl.org/download.
5. Now you can build a game in the setupScene method.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
public Scene setupScene() {
    return Scene.graph.add(
            new GameObject(Vector3f.ZERO, MeshUtil.BuildSquare())
                    .name("MySquare")
    );
}
...
